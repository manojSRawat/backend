# <div align="center"> Shiksha Platform Backend </div>

Shiksha helps you create highly configurable, end-user experiences in education using NDEAR building blocks. This repository houses the source code for the backend of the Shiksha Platform. Since Shiksha leverages NDEAR building blocks, this repository will contain the Shiksha API that the frontend uses, adapters to connect to different NDEAR building blocks e.g. registries, telemetry, etc.
